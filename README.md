# BLE usecases and reaserch project

## BLE communication tests 

In this project the BLE comunication is tested between an Arduino Nano 33 BLE and laptop with step by step tests in setting up the project and progressing in its complecity.

In this project we have abserved the possible security issues in such communication as well as its usabiliti in everyday technology.

The code is written in Python (for laptop executed code) and in ArduinoIDE.

The BLE sniffing logs are collected with Wireshark and Packet logger.

Also used in parts of this project was the Nordic nrf52840 BLE sniffer dongle.
