# BLE usecases and research project

## BLE communication tests 

In this project the BLE communication is tested between an Arduino Nano 33 BLE and laptop with step by step tests in setting up the project and progressing in its complexity.

In this project we have observed the possible security issues in such communication as well as its usability in everyday technology.

The code is written in Python (for laptop executed code) and in ArduinoIDE.

The BLE sniffing logs are collected with Wireshark and Packet logger.

Also used in part of this project was the Nordic nrf52840 BLE sniffer dongle.
